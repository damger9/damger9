### About me
I'm Not_H3, A programmer based in the Netherlands. I program in a number of languages but my favorite ones are:

- Lua(u) - ~3-4 years of experience.
I mainly code roblox games using lua, Worked on a number of projects including a game known as 'Super Blox Soccer', which averages on about a thousand online users at all times. I am currently making my own roblox games as well.

- JavaScript (Node.Js) - ~3-4 years of experience.
Using JS, I mainly code backend applications like APIs using express. I also code discord bots that often include database integrations such as MySQL or MongoDB.

- Typescript - A few months now - Using my JavaScript knowledge it was fairly easy to get familiar with TypeScript.

- C# & C++
I am currently learning C# and C++. No projects done with these languages yet.
